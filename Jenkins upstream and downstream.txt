Jenkins- an open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.

How to setup Delivery Pipeline plugin in Jenkins
Jenkins upstream and downstream jobs

step1. Launch an EC2 intsance and Install Jenkins.
step2. Go to Jenkins dashboard with its public ip and Install all the necessary plugins.
step3. Creating sample jobs for chaining, upstream and downstream.
       Creating free style sample build, test, deploy jobs.

       for sample build job:
       in configure build section choose execute shell and add commands.
       Apply and save run the job.

       for test job:
       in configure build section choose execute shell and add commands.
       go to build triggers in that choose build after other projets are built.
       put the sample build job name so that it will become upstream and test becomes downstream. 
       it will become a chain job once we configure build after other projets are built. 
       now after sample build job it automatically starts building the test job as we did chaining.

       for Deploy job:
       in configure build section choose execute shell and add commands.
       go to build triggers in that choose build after other projets are built.
       put the test job name so that it will become upstream and deploy becomes downstream. 
       it will become a chain job once we configure build after other projets are built. 
       now after test job it automatically starts building the deploy job as we did chaining.

       when we run the build job we can see that after build test runs and finally deploys by chaining.

step4. Install  Delivery Pipeline plugin in Jenkins dashboard.
step5. Add  Delivery Pipeline view for perfect visulazitation of upstream and downstream Jenkins jobs.
step6. In a pipeline component add inital jobs (build) from this all jobs will run and we can see the Pipeline view.
